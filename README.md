### For Development

To spin up the containers:

    docker compose up -d

If this is your first time launching this environment, you will have to run migrations:

    docker compose exec web python manage.py migrate --noinput

At this point you can start interacting with the API, please view the swagger documentation on: http://localhost:8000/docs/

To run unit tests:

    docker compose exec web pytest

To stop all containers:

    docker compose stop
To remove all containers and their associated volumes:

    docker compose down -v



### For Production

To spin up the containers:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

If this is your first time running this environment, you will have to run migrations:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py migrate --noinput    

At this point you can start interacting with the API, please view the swagger documentation on: http://localhost:1337/docs/

To collect static files:

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web python manage.py collectstatic --no-input --clear

To run unit tests:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml exec web pytest
